	<p class='text'>My name is Jeffrey Rivera Negron. I am currently in the Game Design program at UCF as my childhood was littered with video games. Outside of that, I love stories and music, whether that is performing or trying to experiment and write my own. I came to UCF because it was the only school that had its own uniqueness that set them apart from the other schools in Florida. </p>

	<h2 class='title'>My Work</h2>
	<p class="text">My goal is to eventually join a game studio that is very knowledgeable in story-based games and gain a position there where I can be in charge of my own game, with my own written story and lore. But as long as I end up working on games that I believe are worth being created, then that’s where I’ll start. </p>
